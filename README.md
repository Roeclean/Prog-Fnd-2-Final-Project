You can change the information used in the project by changing the information in the file called **Movies'_Information.txt** in this order:

Movie Rating
Movie Title
Movie Genre
Movie's Star Actor First Name
Movie's Star Actor Last Name
Movie's Box Office Gross amount
-----------

You can then repeat this as many times as you want, as long as you put the correct 
amount of iterations in the loop asked for in the program.

The program is _overcomplicated_ due to my instructor requiring the class to not use the " .swap " function.

I have numerous comments in the program explaining what to do, and how most of the code works.
